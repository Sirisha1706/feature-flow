The Project List UI is built using React and Tailwind CSS, following a modular and reusable component-based approach. The goal is to create a dashboard-style interface that displays project details, status, team members, and AI insights.

The app consists of:

Main Layout – Sidebars, Navigation, and Project List.\n
Project List – Displays project cards with details.\n
AI Assistant Panel – Shows insights and team availability.\n
Reusable Components – Buttons, Cards, and Filters.

Approach:
1.Uses dummy JSON data for projects, team members, and AI insights.

Dependencies:
react	Core library for building the UI.
react-dom Enables React to render in the browser.
tailwindcss	Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
postcss & autoprefixer	Required for Tailwind CSS processing.
flowbite-react	Provides pre-built UI components for faster development.
vite	Fast build tool for React.
eslint & prettier	Ensures code quality and formatting.
